# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivam

### 🛠️ From Curiosity to Capability — Rebuilding What Was Never Lost

I'm someone whose journey began in cybersecurity at the age of 12 — experimenting with ethical hacking tools, understanding the flow of packets, bandwidth usage, and even getting my hands on the **hardware roots** of network and security devices.

Though life steered me toward healthcare and insurance operations, those **deep roots in cybersecurity never faded** — and now I'm reconnecting with that passion through code, labs, and meaningful learning.
